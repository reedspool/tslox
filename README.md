# Crafting Interpreters Part 2 in JavaScript

This repo will follow the book [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. In [Part 1](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html#how-the-book-is-organized), Nystrom introduces jargon and context for programming language/interpreter design. Then in Part 2, Nystrom walks through the construction of an interpreter for his Lox language in Java. Here, we will implement that same interpreter in TypeScript (JavaScript with types).
